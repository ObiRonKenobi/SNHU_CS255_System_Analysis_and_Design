# SNHU_CS255_System_Analysis_and_Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass wanted to create an online presence for their driving school.

What did you do particularly well?
I think overall I did well. I believe my UML diagrams were well done.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would update my my technical requirements a bit more and try to include more examples.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I considered the user's need for the system design during the development of use case and activity diagrams. It's important to consider the user needs to ensure 
that the s ystem functionally does everything it is intended to do

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think an important takeaway from this course is that system analysis and design should be a iterative and incrememental process. As such, i would degin by gathering
user requirments and creating user stories. Then I would develop use case and activity diagrams from each instance of a user story. I would then present the results 
to the stakeholders and users for further input. Doing this ensures that all the users needs are likely to be met.
